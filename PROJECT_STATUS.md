## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Backend Services
- **Node.js + Express** - Main server
- **MongoDB** - Data storage
- **Mongoose** - ODM
- **Google Gemini API** - AI analysis and content generation
- **MCP Protocol** - Screenshot service

### Core Services
- **SearchService** - Multi-round search logic
- **GeminiService** - AI analysis and HTML generation
- **MCPScreenshotService** - Webpage screenshots
- **ImageStorageService** - Image storage management
- **MarkdownService** - Document generation

### Data Models
- **Report** - Main report entity
- **Image** - Image metadata
- **Search** - Search records

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Concurrency Control
- Search batch size: 5 concurrent requests
- Screenshot batch size: 3 concurrent requests
- Content scraping limit: 3000 characters

### Caching Strategy
- Static file cache: 1 day
- Image compression: Original 90%, Thumbnail 80%
- HTTP cache headers configuration

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation (screenshot failures don't affect search)
- Retry mechanisms
- Detailed logging

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Multi-Round Search
- `POST /api/iterative-search` - Start search
- `GET /api/iterative-search/:reportId/status` - Query status
- `GET /api/iterative-search/:reportId/result` - Get results
- `GET /api/iterative-search/:reportId/markdown` - Download Markdown
- `GET /api/iterative-search/reports` - List reports

### Screenshot Management
- `GET /screenshots/:year/:month/:filename` - Access screenshots
- `GET /api/screenshots` - List screenshots
- `GET /api/screenshots/stats` - Storage statistics
- `DELETE /api/screenshots/:imageId` - Delete screenshot

## 🧪 Test Results

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Health check - Normal
- ✅ Multi-round search - Normal (2-3 rounds)
- ✅ HTML generation - Normal (6000+ characters)
- ✅ Markdown download - Normal (3000+ characters)
- ✅ Screenshot API - Normal
- ✅ Report listing - Normal

### Performance Testing
- Search completion time: 60-120 seconds
- HTML generation: Normal
- Markdown generation: Normal
- Concurrent processing: Stable

## 🔍 Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Analysis Result Field** - Occasionally shows as null in database queries, but functionality works
2. **Screenshot Service** - Some websites may refuse screenshot requests
3. **Content Scraping** - Some websites have anti-crawling mechanisms

### Solutions
1. Database field issue fixed, new searches work normally
2. Screenshot failures gracefully degrade, don't affect main functionality
3. Content scraping failures fall back to search snippets

## 📈 Next Steps
